# Smart Index

Smart Index is a Script developed to run within Photoshop, it is a tool developed for professional photographers to automate the creation of photographic indexes.
 
 One of the most traditional ways of presenting the results of a photographic work is through photographic indexes, which consist of assembling small photographic proofs arranged side by side on sheets of photo paper, usually in A4 size.

In the most common forms, the photographic indexes only list the images and their respective identification numbers. The Smart Index proposal is to enrich the indexes with some additional information, previously set by the photographer in order to direct and make the customer's choice more accurate.
